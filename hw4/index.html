            As the spring constant (k<sub>s</sub>) decreases, the cloth rests more loosely on the sphere. In other words, a greater portion of the cloth falls underneath the sphere. As the spring constant decreases, the cloth is less rigid, and hence the individual point masses on the cloth is more loosely coupled together, resulting in a more loose cloth.

        <p>
            Increasing the density of the cloth makes it heavier. As a result, the cloth will fall faster due to greater gravitational force acting on it.
            When a denser cloth falls on itself, it tends to create more pronounced folds and creases, and it settles quicker due to its weight.
            The interactions between different parts of the cloth, such as friction and collision, are more pronounced, leading to a more compact and less floaty settling.

            <br /><br />
            Increasing ks makes the cloth stiffer. Stiffer cloths resist bending and folding, leading to less pronounced creases when the cloth
            falls on itself. The cloth tends to maintain its shape more, leading to less realistic but more controlled simulations. When a stiffer cloth interacts with itself,
            the folds and bends are more shallow, and the cloth is less likely to drape smoothly over surfaces or itself.

            Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
        </h3>
        <p>
            The vertex shader processes each vertex of a model, determining its position and basic properties, like how it's illuminated.
            After that, the fragment shader takes over, calculating the color and texture of each pixel on the model based on the information
            provided by the vertex shader and additional data like lighting and material properties. Together, these shaders work to create the
            final visual output, allowing for detailed lighting and material effects on 3D objects.

        <p>
            The Blinn-Phong shading model is a simplified approach to simulating how light interacts with surfaces in 3D graphics, enhancing realism.
            It combines ambient, diffuse and specular lighting to create a realistic image.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ambient Lighting: This is a constant lighting applied to all parts of the object equally, regardless of its orientation or position relative to light sources. It's a way to ensure that no part of the object is completely dark, simulating the effect of indirect light that bounces around the environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Diffuse Lighting: This represents the light that comes from a source and hits the object, spreading uniformly across its surface. Diffuse lighting intensity depends on the angle between the light source and the surface normal (a perpendicular vector to the surface). The more directly the light hits the surface, the brighter it appears.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Specular Lighting: This is the shiny highlight you see when the light reflects off a surface directly towards the viewer. In the Blinn-Phong model, this is calculated using the halfway vector between the viewer's direction and the light source direction, making it computationally simpler than the Phong model. The size and intensity of the specular highlight are controlled by the material's shininess coefficient; a higher value results in a smaller, sharper highlight, while a lower value produces a broader, dimmer one.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Bump mapping alters the normal vectors during shading to simulate depth without changing the model's geometry, offering good 
            performance with negligible impact from the model's resolution. Displacement mapping, on the other hand, physically modifies the 
            geometry by displacing vertices along their normals according to a height map, leading to actual changes in the model's 
            silhouette and more realistic results. However, this method is computationally more demanding and its effectiveness greatly relies 
            on the model's resolution; finer meshes can depict detailed displacements, while coarser meshes may result in less detailed and 
            blockier surfaces, as seen through the images above.
